# GPS_Sim
Term project for Math 5610 - Numerical Analysis I. Simulates a constellation of GPS satellites that report their distance to a receiver on Earth which then finds the most likely latitude and longitude of the receiver. <br/><br/>

The vehicle.class was a provided class that generates a path along the surface of the Earth and outputs N evenly spaced points along that path. This data is then outputted to the various .dat files found in the repository. It is unneccsary to actually use the vehicle.class file unless you want to generate a new test case. <br/><br/>

satellite.java and receiver.java are the files written by me as requested for the assignment
